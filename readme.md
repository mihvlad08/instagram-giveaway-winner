# Instagram-Giveaway-Winner

Instagram-Giveaway-Winner is a Python library for automating the processes of joining (and winning!) giveaways hosted on Instagram built with Selenium.

## Installation

To start, use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Selenium
```bash
python3 -m pip install selenium
```
And then create a new file in project root, credentials.py where you have to add
2 variables, username and password.
```python
username = 'username here'
password = 'your password here'
```
Finally, run the script with the generic Python command
```bash
python3 main.py
```
